# A-Basic-JDBC-Project

# Overview:

 Purpose: The code creates a basic product management application using Java and JDBC.

 Functionality: Stores and retrieves product information (ID, name, description, price) in a MySQL database.
Implements CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete individual product records.
Provides a text-based user interface for interaction.

# Code Structure:

Classes:
Product: Represents a product with fields for ID, name, description, and price.
Controller: Manages database interactions using JDBC.
View: Provides the user interface and handles user input.

# Key Features:

JDBC: Connects to a MySQL database using JDBC and executes prepared statements.
CRUD Operations: Implements basic CRUD functionality for product records.
Text-Based UI: Uses a text-based menu system for user interaction.
Areas for Improvement:

 Error Handling: Improve error handling for invalid user input and database issues.
Prepared Statements: Use prepared statements for all database operations to prevent SQL injection.
Connection Management: Consider connection pooling for efficient database connection management.
Unit Tests: Implement unit tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
Variable Naming: Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., productController instead of con).
Database Closure: Explicitly close database connections after use to avoid resource leaks.

# Additional Features:
Implement searching, sorting, and listing all products.
Consider a more user-friendly interface (e.g., graphical).
Implement validation for user input.
Add logging for debugging and auditing.
